T-minus five days until I start the Flatiron bootcamp. I took a break from some Git exercise to bring you all this update!

I have made a lot of changes to this site under the hood. Mainly, I converted the content section to the CSS "grid" display style. I also switched the navbar back to using Flexbox.

If you're on a laptop or desktop, expand the browser to full screen and you'll notice that blog posts now line up in rows and columns. On a mobile device, the posts will collapse into a single column. This is all thanks to CSS Grid!

Now that the main content is laid out in a grid system, it will be much easier to make the website more "responsive." I'll cover responsive web design in more detail soon.

Thank you for reading and have a great week.
