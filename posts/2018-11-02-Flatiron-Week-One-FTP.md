I'm in week one of the Flatiron bootcamp! I'm writing this on Friday afternoon.

My substantive update for this post is that I finally implemented (Safe) File Transfer Protocol. I used a guide from [Indiana University](https://kb.iu.edu/d/akom). SFTP makes uploading the website files much faster.

So much has happened in five days, but here are some of my main thoughts:

<dt>Cohort</dt>

<dd>The first cohort is small.</dd>

<dd>There are 7 other people in cohort (Kwam, Andy, Blair, Cory, Paris, Will, and Kaeland).</dd>

<dt>Topics</dt>

<dd>We went straight to Ruby, Git, and Bash.</dd>

<dt>Schedule</dt>

<dd>Classes really do run from 9:00 a.m. until 6:00 p.m.</dd>

<dd>I haven't left campus before 6:30 p.m.</dd>

<dt>Homework</dt>

<dd>The instructors deploy new labs after class gets out.</dd>

<dd>We used concepts from those labs the next day.</dd>

<dt>Pair Programing</dt>

<dd>We've already used pair programming.</dd>

<dd>Yesterday, we paired up to work on a lab. We learned how pair programming traditionally involves a "navigator" and a "driver," and got the chance to implement this process to solve a lab.</dd>

<dt>Active Learning</dt>

<dd>Most of the day is spent on active learning.</dd>

<dd>There are lectures, but they only last for an hour or two in the mornings.</dd>

<dd>We spend the rest of the day working on labs and helping each other out with debugging.</dd>
