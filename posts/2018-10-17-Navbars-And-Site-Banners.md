Flatiron's software engineering immersive program in Atlanta starts in just a few days and I could not be more excited. So excited that I'm doing a mid-week update to the site! The main changes include removing Flexbox (for now), adding a functional navigation bar, adding a "hero banner," and incorporating google analytics.

<dt>Flexbox</dt>

<dd>I had a lot of fun working with Flexbox while writing my last post. However, I removed the Flexbox display to see how much I could do with just HTML and CSS's normal flow. As it turns out, everything you see here can be developed without Flexbox.</dd>

<dt>Navigation Bar</dt>

<dd>Creating the navigation bar took a bit of trial and error. I eventually landed on sleek [navbar tutorial](https://wearefieldtrip.com/journal/css-horizontal-navigation-bar/) from Fieldtrip. The instructions were clear and concise.</dd>

<dt>The Banner</dt>

<dd>A hero banner, like the image above, is a very large banner image used in website design to help engage users. Sites like [Webdesignerdepot](https://www.webdesignerdepot.com/) and [artonic](https://www.artonicweb.com/learn/hero-images/) have great examples. This [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb_EwQOa_ao) on youtube was a good guide.</dd>

<dt>Google Analytics</dt>

<dd>If you right click and "View Page Source," you might notice a "google-site-verification" item in the `head`. I set up the verification and google analytics for this site after watching [video by Maile Ohye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=El3IZFGERbM) from google webmasters.</dd>

I hope you enjoyed reading this post. I'll be back soon with more updates about my software engineering journey.
